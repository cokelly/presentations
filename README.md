# Presentations

Some presentations, in either or both pdf and html, as well as their source md (markdown) files. The FIGS folder is where the locally hosted figure files are located and should not be of interest to anyone but me when I create the presentations. They are linked to in the html presentations, though, but are not needed locally (the links are to this repo).

Note that you will have to download the pdf presentations if you want to make full use of them: the github pdf files viewer does not allow to click links. To visualise the html versions as webpages, please see the same files [here](https://julien-arino.github.io/presentations/).
