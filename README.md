# Presentations

Some presentations, in either or both pdf and html. The FIGS folder is where the locally hosted figure files are located and should not be of interest to anyone but me when I create the presentations. They are linked to in the html presentations, though, but are not needed locally (the links are to this repo).

Note that you will have to download the presentations if you want to make full use of them: the html files are too large to view within github and the pdf files viewer does not allow to click links. Also, note that embedded features (movies, Shiny scripts) only work in the html version.
